I miss you so much. I know it would be really hard for you not seeing me for a year, but I really enjoy the life here, and I hope you will be happy with me.");

He is really a funny guy and making programming as easy understanding as possible. You know I always want to learn programming and now I get a chance in UNC. I am even thinking about taking computer science as major or a minor.");
